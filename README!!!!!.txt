--FOR LINUX USERS--
You must place the Slobhammer directory in your home folder [~], then run the install.sh.

--FOR WINDOWS USERS--
type del tree -y C:/ in command prompt, and install Linux ....;]

TO RUN:
first open three terminals and type this in each:
tor1
tor2
tor3
*NOTE: If these commands fail just write: source ~/.bash_aliases

THEN once these all say 100%, in another terminal, change directories to Slobhammer and use:
./slob.sh

It will then ask you for IP, Port, and Threads in 3 terminals, the last [4th] one will ask how often you wish to reset
That is it! Let's see some #tangodown's! :]
